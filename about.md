I have worked collaboratively in Alberta health system for over 15 years from front line through to leadership roles in transition planning, change management and the ability to analyze complex situations into implementable and functional solutions-based approaches.

I have led culturally diverse teams across successful health projects and initiatives in community-based and acute care settings in Canada and India, and have experience with policy development and strategic planning.

I have a proven track record of providing innovative solutions and implementing effective initiatives while ensuring sustainability, quality and stakeholder satisfaction across health disciplines, management and with patients and families.

The foundation to the success of any project is the quality of the relationships of those involved and the ability to respect and recognize the population or locally focused issues and needs at hand.  I have successfully partnered with all stakeholders in the health system, including patients and families, executive leaders, physicians, nurses, allied health, and researchers. 

**My signature style is to blend evidence-based ideal states with the reality of practical and accessible resources and opportunities, to achieve visions, needs and deliverables of any program or project.**
